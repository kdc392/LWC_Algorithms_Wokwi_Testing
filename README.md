# LWC_Algorithms_Wokwi_Testing
These scripts test 3 main LWC algorithms(Ascon, ChaCha, and Speck) in their base states on ESP32 and Arduino Mega hardware in Wokwi hardware simulator. 

Wokwi does not have extensive library support so I had to directly pull certain files from the LWCrypto library to accruately use those algorithms, all those files have the correct copyright at the top and were not written by me, ones without that copyright were written by me.
